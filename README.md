Heavily inspired and modeled after [@jsulpis/talk-design-systems](https://github.com/jsulpis/talk-design-systems "Building Future-Proof Design Systems: A Practical Guide to Framework Independence").

Use `pnpm` to install dependencies and run the project. Basic `npm` commands are not supported. Consult installation manual for `pnpm` first behind [this link](https://pnpm.io/installation "Installation | pnpm").

## Install dependencies

After you've got `pnpm` installed, run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```
